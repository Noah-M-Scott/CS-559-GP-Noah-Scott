Feeding Frenzy (Fish Game)

ENTER to start, WASD to move, SPACE to sink and rise, ARROW LEFT/RIGHT to move camera

Eat the fish on your tier or lower to grow larger (green < yellow < orange < red), once you grow large enough you move to the next level.

Bigger fish in a tier give you more points/size than smaller fish.

Fish have boid logic, and fish larger than you will steer to eat you if you get near.

Silver and Gold bubbles can be eaten for a score and size bonus, they become more rare with higher levels, but become worth more.

Urchins rise from the ground, touching them is instant death, they become more common on higher levels.

Increasing Difficulty:
  Bigger fish spawn more often on higher levels
  Urchins spawn more often on higher levels
  Bubbles spawn less often on higher levels
  The size requirment grows with each level
